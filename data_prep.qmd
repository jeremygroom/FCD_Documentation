# Preparing Your Data

### **Your data folder**

Users provide a suite of folders that follow this format:

![Required structure of data input folders and the script control Excel file.](/images/data_folders.png){#fig-LABEL fig-alt="ALT"}

Notice that the parent folder is called “California 2020”. The subfolders with years in them (CSV Status, GRM CSV, LU) need to have the same year, which is the user’s year of interest. This is important! The script will look for these files with these year.

Be sure to include all of these folders! The code may get unhappy if they are missing. Include the folders but leave them empty if you have nothing to put in them (e.g., Annual_FMRL and LU 2020 may be specific to California and a few other states).

The USDA Forest Service FIA program personnel can provide the CSV files that populate these folders. It should be evident which go where (they will give you CSV Status and GRM CSV folders, for instance).\
We will now spend a great deal of verbiage describing what goes into Script_Controls.xlsx.
